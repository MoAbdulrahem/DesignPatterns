# Weather Station

### Observer Pattern
* We have a weather station that captures weather parameters in real time through sensors and updates a WeatherStationClass with the captured data
* We also have multiple display elements (i.e. phone display, LCD display ...etc) that display the weather data
* It's required to make the display elements update their data automatically as soon as the WeatherStation updates its values of the current weather conditions.
